# Project-4##Using Machine Learning to Predict Heart Diseasenote: heartX.zip must be unzipped for q.py to function.###We used kerastuner sequential to self-optimize its own model.After tuning the model to almost 92% accuracy with minimal loss, we used the data columns to devise a questionnaire that would be able to pass the answers to the already trained model and output a prediction on whether the respondent is likey to have heart disease.We used bootstrap html and css to create a user-friendly front-end, and included some insights using tableau graphs.q.py is the flask app and must be running to take the quiz. The website 'quiz' button then redirects the user to the flask app's instance.
